The addon is a configurable buff checker for your raids. This addon will only work, if you're in a raid group.

**NOTE:** Raid Chat printing is limited to Raid Leader and Raid Officer roles to avoid clutter. Only Raid Leader OR Raid Officer should have raid chat printing enabled.

# Addon Usage

To use this addon, use commands:

**/sg**

**/spyinggnome**

You always get a print out in chat (Unless you have "SpyingGnome Enabled" unchecked):

And if you check "Enable Status Report Printing in Raid Chat" and "Print to raid chat after a ready check", you can do a check with a raid chat announcement by using the button or ready check in /sg:

Ready check status print after ready check is complete:

I also added protection potions, to check if everyone has pre-potted. Added all protection types for possible future use:

After clicking the button in /sg:
