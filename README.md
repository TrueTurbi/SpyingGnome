To use this addon, use commands:
**/sg**,
**/spyinggnome**

The addon is a configurable buff checker for your raids. This addon will only work, if you're in a raid group.
To use the raid chat announcements, it requires you to be either Raid Leader or Raid Officer.

You always get a print out in chat, regardless of settings:

And if you check the two top boxes, you can do a check with a raid chat announcement by using the button or ready check in /sg:

I also added protection potions, to check if everyone has pre-potted. Added all protection types for possible future use:
